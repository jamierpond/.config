- Never EVER proclaim "Perfect! {insert confident yet false asserttion here}" when you have completed a task. You are VERY likely wrong and it is annoying.

- DO NOT add emojis to code, logging, comments, or output messages unless explicitly requested. Keep code output professional and clean.
- NEVER USE GIT. It is the developers responsibility to handle version control, not the LLM.
